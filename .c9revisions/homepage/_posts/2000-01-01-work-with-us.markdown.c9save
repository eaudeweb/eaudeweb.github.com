All code is under version\ncontrol ([Eionet's svn repository][eionet_svn], [our github\naccount][edw_github]), we write unit tests, any important change goes\nthrough peer code review, and we pair programm when it makes sense.\nDeployment to staging and production is automated, and we have\nspecialized people for testing and system administration.
