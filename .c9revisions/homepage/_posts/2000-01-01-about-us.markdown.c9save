We're in business in this formula since 2006, but most of\nus have worked together as a team since 1999.\n\nWe attend trainings and conferences all the time and we keep ourselves\ninformed about new technologies, solutions and standards. This allows us\nuse emerging technology when developing applications and also suggest\nthe suitable solutions to our clients when we start new ones.\n\nOur products and services respect modern standards for accessibility,\nsyndication and Web services. Most of our work is open source and that's\nthe way we like it.\n\nOver the years we worked a lot with content management systems and\nportal toolkits so we eventually built our own. It's called Naaya, it's\nmade in Zope and it's fully open source. It's our pride and joy because\nit's simple to use, simple to extend and elegant to program. We'll have\na website for it soon.\n\nWeb applications’ interoperability is a big component of our work, so we’ve \nbeen increasingly involved into the Semantic Web principles and tools, working with\n<a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/environment/seis/\">SEIS</a> and \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_data\">Open Data</a> guidelines and implementations.\n\n### The name ###\n\nEau de Web is a paraphrase of *eau de parfum*, meaning a fragrance of Web, close to its essence.\n\n\n### Eau de Web's Manifesto ###\n\nThe drives of our activities are the open source culture and the use of\nopen standards due to the benefits of code reuse, openness in\nparticipating in projects worldwide, peer review and contributions from\na wide community of developers.\n"]],"start1":0,"start2":0,"length1":0,"length2":1676}]],"length":1676}
