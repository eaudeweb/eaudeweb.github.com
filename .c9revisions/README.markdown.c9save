A draft version is hosted [on github][github-draft]\nand the public version is on [eaudeweb.ro][edw].\n\n## Content organization ##\n\nContent is taken from any file with the `.markdown` extension. There are\na few standalone pages, e.g. `index.markdown` for the homepage and\n`news/2010.markdown` for the 2010 news archive. Other pages are taken\nfrom blog-like lists of posts, for example `news/_posts`. Each Markdown\npage has a *YAML front matter*, some metadata that describes the page:\ntitle, name of layout template (see below), perhaps the path of a logo\nor icon.\n\nThe `_posts` folders are useful for news items, but also for managing\nmany pieces of similar content: the sections of the homepage and the\nlist of clients. Let's call them \"fake posts\". Jekyll wants every post\nto have a date, so our fake posts are dated \"1 January 2000\". They also\nhave a \"date\" value in their YAML front-matter so we can change the sort\norder without renaming files. Each fake post results in a page;\nsometimes this is useful (list of clients), sometimes not (sections of\nthe homepage) - but we just ignore them.\n\n## Layout ##\n\nAll pages are rendered using templates found in the `_layout` folder. A\nfair amount of transformation and organization happens in there,\nespecially on the homepage. Static resources are copied unmodified by\nJekyll.\n\n## Making changes ##\n\nTo change any aspect of the site, edit the relevant files, then re-run\nJekyll. For quick changes to an existing file, GitHub has a built-in\neditor. For a more friendly experience one can use [Cloud9][]: create an\naccount, import the github repository\n(`git@github.com:eaudeweb/eaudeweb.github.com.git`), make some changes,\nthen, from the bottom console, run: `git add .`, `git commit -m \"edit\ncontent\"`, `git push` (feel free to replace \"edit content\" with a more\nuseful explanation). The code is sent to GitHub, which will re-generate\nthe [draft website][github-draft], so you can see the results.\n\nFor a more efficient editing experience, install Jekyll locally, and\nstart it in the background with `jekyll --auto --serve`; it will serve\nthe website on port 4000 and automatically pick up any changes.\n\n## Deployment ##\n\nA Jekyll site is a collection of static files, so it can be served\nstraight from the filesystem by a web server like Apache. However, to\nkeep search engines from the draft website, a meta tag is inserted,\nwhich needs to be removed when deploying to production, by running\n`jekyll --user=production`. Afterwards the site in `_site` is ready to\nbe copied on production.\n\nDeployment is automated, just run:\n\n    fab deploy\n\n## External documentation ##\n\n* [Markdown syntax](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)\n\n\n[jekyll]: http://jekyllrb.com/\n[github-draft]: http://eaudeweb.github.com/\n[edw]: http://eaudeweb.ro/\n[cloud9]: http://c9.io/\n"]],"start1":0,"start2":0,"length1":0,"length2":2943}]],"length":2943}
