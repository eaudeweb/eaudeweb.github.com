It also\nassumes you already have a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account, and\nthat it has editing permissions for [the eaudeweb.github.com\nrepository](https://github.com/eaudeweb/eaudeweb.github.com).\n\nFirst, go to [c9.io](http://c9.io/), create an account, and log in. From\nyour account page, click on the \"+\" button (where it says \"Create a\nproject here\"), and then \"Clone from URL\". Paste the following URL:\n\n    git@github.com:eaudeweb/eaudeweb.github.com.git\n\nIt will instruct you to copy the public SSH key to your GitHub account\nso please do that. You can use \"Cloud9\" as the title for this key. Then\ngo back to the Cloud9 page, click \"OK\", and in a few seconds the project\nshould be ready. Click on the green \"Start editing\" button.\n\n\n## Editing ##\n\nIn the Cloud9 editor, run the following commands to bring your project\nup to date:\n\n    git fetch\n    git reset origin/master --hard\n\nAfter you make some changes (see below), to upload your work, run:\n\n    git add .\n    git commit -m \"Add news item about some conference\"\n    git push\n\nThe message in the 2nd command should describe the changes you have\nmade. Also, if the 3rd command fails, it means someone else made changes\nat the same time. Ask for help.\n\n## Layout of files ##\n\nNews items, clients, and job listings are stored in files, respectively\nin the folders `news/_posts`, `clients/_posts` and `team/_posts`. To add\na news item, for example, go to `news/_posts` and create a file. Be\ncareful with the filename, it should be in the format\n`yyyy-mm-dd-TITLE.markdown`, like the existing files.\n\nAs for the file contents, start from an existing news item, and change\nwhatever is needed. The teaser is displayed on the homepage as-is, and\nshould be repeated in the body. The image normally resides in the\n/images/ folder at the top of the repository. The body uses [Markdown\nsyntax](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax). Job\npostings are very similar to news items, only with fewer fields.\n\nClients are different though: they have a fake date in the filename\n(because it's mandatory) and another fake date in their metadata (used\nfor sorting on the homepage). They also have a teaser, and it should be\nrepeated in the body.\n"]],"start1":0,"start2":0,"length1":0,"length2":2327}]],"length":2327}
