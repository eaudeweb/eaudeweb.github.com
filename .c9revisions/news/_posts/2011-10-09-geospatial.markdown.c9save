Most of the first day was for presentations, followed by\nworkshops, that continued on the 2nd day. Some of the presentation\nhighlights:\n\n* eHarta is a dataset of digitised historical maps of Romania. It won\n  the \"better data\" award at the [Open Data Challenge][]. These maps,\n  and many others, are freely available on [their GeoServer website][].\n* Highlights from a century-old account of mapping the Romanian\n  coastline.\n* An application for maritime and river navigation, showing terrain,\n  visual features, boat traffic and water depth cues.\n* An overview of the OpenStreetMap database, how to contribute, and\n  existing applications.\n* Reconstructing a 3D space based on a collection of 2D images.\n\nWe attended the workshops about the OpenGeo Suite and GDAL/ORG. This\nwould have been handy knowledge in building the [AoA map search\ninterface][], where we discovered mapping the hard way, blisfully\nignorant of some useful open-source tools. Also attended a workshop\nabout statistics on geographic data using the R language. I suspect\nsimilar results can be achieved using SciPy, but it was a refreshing\nlook at another way of doing things.\n\n[geospatial.org seminar]: http://earth.unibuc.ro/osgeo/bucuresti2011\n[open data challenge]: http://opendatachallenge.org/\n[their geoserver website]: http://earth.unibuc.ro/geoserver/\n[aoa map search interface]: http://www.eea.europa.eu/themes/regions/pan-european/virtual-library/\n"]],"start1":0,"start2":0,"length1":0,"length2":1861}]],"length":1861}
