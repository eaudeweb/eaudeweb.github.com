It was comforting to\nknow that there are so many people that can share their knowledge and\nexperiences as python developers and as programmers in general so close\nto each other.\n\nThe conference wasn't just about Python as a programming language. It\nwas much more. It was about coders, hackers, scientists, companies and\nothers who use Python every day to solve their problems and are glad to\nshare their knowledge with you.\n\nThere was so much stuff to learn that at some point it got really\nirritating that we couldn't attend a lot of important speeches and\ndiscussions. Fortunately there are recordings of every speech (or\nalmost) here on pycon's blip.tv [channel][].\n\nThere where many great talks and lightning talks at PyCon, but there\nwhere a few that were more than great. To name a few:\n\n* [Reverse-engineering Ian Bicking's brain: inside pip and\n  virtualenv][pip-talk] by Carl Meyer\n* [API Design anti-patterns][antipatterns-talk] by Alex Martelli\n* [API Design: Lessons Learned][apilessons-talk] by Raymond Hettinger\n\nWe also had the pleasure of participating in sprints. Alexandru Plugaru\nand Andrei Laza worked on zc.buildout with guidance from Jim Fulton and\nmanaged to solve a few bugs in the package. Alex Morega worked with the\npip guys.\n\nHere are a few pictures: [Picasa album][]\n\n[channel]: http://pycon.blip.tv/\n[pip-talk]: http://us.pycon.org/2011/schedule/presentations/198/\n[antipatterns-talk]: http://us.pycon.org/2011/schedule/presentations/88/\n[apilessons-talk]: http://us.pycon.org/2011/schedule/presentations/263/\n[picasa_album]: https://picasaweb.google.com/105609546437379616640/PyCon2011?feat=directlink\n"]],"start1":0,"start2":0,"length1":0,"length2":2231}]],"length":2231}
