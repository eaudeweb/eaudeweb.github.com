The Eau de Web sent a decent-sized delegation (Mihai\nDincă, Bogdan Tănase, Alex Morega) and we came back with new knowledge:\n\n* Upcoming languages (Rust, Dart)\n* Application architecture (James Coglan described how they split up a\n  big monolithic Rails application at Songkick)\n* Good and bad use of relational databases (Andrew Godwin)\n* Documenting REST APIs (Lukáš Linhart)\n* Packaging code, templates and stylesheets for a single-page app (Nick\n  Fisher, SoundCloud)\n\n... and much more. Conference organizers had enough foresight to\ndistribute annotated maps of beer places in central Brno so we got a\ngood sampling of local beer and quisine.\n\n[RuPy]: http://12.rupy.eu/\n"]],"start1":0,"start2":0,"length1":0,"length2":933}]],"length":933}
