It is always awesome, and\n  highly recommended for all Plone developers and customers alike\n---\n\nThis was our (Alec and Alin's) 5th Plone Conference in a row. As always was very nice\nto keep in touch with the Plone community, to do our usual lighting talks and attend\nthe sprint sessions.\n\nThe talk were interesting and there was an increased interest in [pylonsproject.org][prj]\n\nDuring sprint sessions we focused on releasing a set of new packages on [plone.org][plone] and\n[pypi.python.org][pypi], including updated documentation and final testing on the last Plone\nrelease. By now eea.tags, eea.geotags, eea.relations, eea.daviz, eea.facetednavigation\nare into the wild :)\n\n[prj]: http://pylonsproject.org\n[plone]: http://www.plone.org\n[pypi]: http://pypi.python.org\n"]],"start1":0,"start2":0,"length1":0,"length2":1032}]],"length":1032}
