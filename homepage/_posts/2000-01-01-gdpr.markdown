1. Personal data that we collect automatically.

<a/>

1.  Personal data you give to us

Eau de Web needs to know certain information about you in order to provide a tailored job offer. This will enable us to provide you with the best opportunities, and should save you time in not having to search through information about jobs and services that are not relevant to you.

    We also receive personal data about Candidate from other sources. Depending on the relevant circumstances and applicable local laws and requirements, these may include personal data received in the following situations:

    - Your referees may disclose personal information about you;
    - Our Clients may share personal information about you with us;
    - We may obtain information about you from searching for potential Candidate from third party sources, such as LinkedIn and other job sites;
    - If you 'like' our page on Facebook or 'follow' us we will receive your personal information from those sites; and
    - If you were referred to us through an RPO or an MSP supplier, they may share personal information about you with us.

3.  Personal data we collect automatically

    To the extent that you access our website or read or click on an email from us, where appropriate and in accordance with any local laws and requirements, we may also collect your data automatically or through you providing it to us. For more information please send an email to <dpo@eaudeweb.ro>.

*Client data*

We collect Client personal data in three ways:

1. Personal data that we receive directly from you;
1. Personal data that we receive from other sources; and
1. Personal data that we collect automatically.
 
<a/>

1.  Personal data that we receive directly from you

    Both parties we share the same goal â€“ to make sure that you have the best products/services for your organization. We will receive data directly from you in two ways:
    
- Where you contact us proactively, usually by phone or email; and/or
- Where we contact you, either by phone or email, or through our staff activities more generally.

2.  Personal data we receive from other sources

- Where appropriate and in accordance with any local laws and requirements, we may seek more information about you or your colleagues from other sources generally by way of due diligence or other market intelligence including:
- From third party market research and by analyzing online and offline media (which we may do ourselves, or employ other organizations to do for us);
- From delegate lists at relevant events; and
- From other limited sources and third parties (for example from our Candidates to the extent that they provide us with your details to act as a referee for them).

3.  Personal data we collect via our website

- To the extent that you access our website or read or click on an email from us, where appropriate and in accordance with any local laws and requirements, we may also collect your data automatically or through you providing it to us. For more information please send an email to <dpo@eaudeweb.ro>.

*Website users*

When you visit our website there is certain information that we may automatically collect, whether or not you decide to use our services. This includes your IP address, the date and the times and frequency with which you access the website and the way you browse its content. We will also collect data from you when you contact us via the website, for example by using the chat function.

We collect your data automatically via cookies, in line with cookie settings in your browser. If you are also a Candidate or Client of Eau de Web, we may use data from your use of our websites to enhance other aspects of our communications with or service to you.

*******************************

**HOW DO WE SAFEGUARD YOUR PERSONAL DATA?**

We are committed to taking all reasonable and appropriate steps to protect the personal information that we hold from misuse, loss, or unauthorized access. We do this by having in place a range of appropriate technical and organizational measures. These include measures to deal with any suspected data breach.

If you suspect any misuse or loss of or unauthorized access to your personal information please let us know immediately, by sending an email to <dpo@eaudeweb.ro>.

********************************

**HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR PERSONAL DATA FOR?**

We will Delete your personal data from our systems if we have not had any meaningful contact with you (or, where appropriate, the company you are working for or with) for two years (or for such longer period as up to 75 years when the law or relevant regulators require us to preserve your data). After this period, it is likely your data will no longer be relevant for the purposes for which it was collected.

For those Candidates whose services are provided via a third party company or other entity, "meaningful contact" with you means meaningful contact with the company or entity which supplies your services. Where we are notified by such company or entity that it no longer has that relationship with you, we will retain your data for no longer than two years from that point or, if later, for the period of two years from the point we subsequently have meaningful contact directly with you.

When we refer to "meaningful contact", we mean, for example, communication between us (either verbal or written), or where you are actively engaging with our services. If you are a Candidate we will consider there to be meaningful contact with you if you submit your updated CV onto our website or take part in any of our projects. We will also consider it meaningful contact if you communicate with us about potential roles, either by verbal or written communication or click through from any of our marketing communications. Your receipt, opening or reading of an email or other digital message from us will not count as meaningful contact â€“ this will only occur in cases where you click-through or reply directly.

********************************

**HOW CAN YOU ACCESS, AMEND OR TAKE BACK THE PERSONAL DATA THAT YOU HAVE GIVEN TO US?**

One of the GDPR's main objectives is to protect and clarify the rights of EU citizens and individuals in the EU with regards to data privacy. This means that you retain various rights in respect of your data, even once you have given it to us. These are described in more detail below.

To get in touch about these rights, please contact us. We will seek to deal with your request without undue delay, and in any event within one month (subject to any extensions to which we are lawfully entitled). Please note that we may keep a record of your communications to help us resolve any issues which you raise

Right to object: this right enables you to object to us processing your personal data
where we do so for one of the following four reasons:

1. our legitimate interests;
1. to enable us to perform a task in the public interest or exercise official authority;
1. to send you direct marketing materials; and
1. for scientific, historical, research, or statistical purposes.

The "legitimate interests" and "direct marketing" categories above are the ones most likely to apply to our Website Users, Candidates, Clients and Suppliers. If your objection relates to us processing your personal data because we deem it necessary for your legitimate interests, we must act on your objection by ceasing the activity in question unless:

- we can show that we have compelling legitimate grounds for processing which overrides your interests; or
- we are processing your data for the establishment, exercise or defense of a legal claim.
- If your objection relates to direct marketing, we must act on your objection by ceasing this activity.

Right to withdraw consent: Where we have obtained your consent to process your personal data for certain activities (for example, for our communication arrangements or automatic profiling), you may withdraw this consent at any time and we will cease to carry out the particular activity that you previously consented to unless we consider that there is an alternative reason to justify our continued processing of your data for this purpose in which case we will inform you of this condition.

Data Subject Access Requests (DSAR): You may ask us to confirm what information we hold about you at any time, and request us to modify, update or Delete such information. We may ask you to verify your identity and for more information about your request. If we provide you with access to the information we hold about you, we will not charge you for this unless your request is "manifestly unfounded or excessive". If you request further copies of this information from us, we may charge you a reasonable administrative cost where legally permissible. Where we are legally permitted to do so, we may refuse your request. If we refuse your request we will always tell you the reasons for doing so.

Please note that in certain of the jurisdictions in which we operate, we comply with additional local law requirements regarding data subject access requests and may refuse your request in accordance with such laws. For more information in relation to your jurisdiction, please send an email to <dpo@eaudeweb.ro>.

Right to erasure: You have the right to request that we erase your personal data in certain circumstances. Normally, the information must meet one of the following criteria:

- the data are no longer necessary for the purpose for which we originally collected and/or processed them;
- where previously given, you have withdrawn your consent to us processing your data, and there is no other valid reason for us to continue processing;
- the data has been processed unlawfully (i.e. in a manner which does not comply with the GDPR);
- it is necessary for the data to be erased in order for us to comply with our legal obligations as a data controller; or
- if we process the data because we believe it necessary to do so for our legitimate interests, you object to the processing and we are unable to demonstrate overriding legitimate grounds for our continued processing.

Please note that in certain of the jurisdictions in which we operate, we comply with additional local law requirements regarding data subject right to erasure and may refuse your request in accordance with local laws. For more information in relation to your jurisdiction, please send an email to <dpo@eaudeweb.ro>.

We would only be entitled to refuse to comply with your request for one of the following reasons:

- to exercise the right of freedom of expression and information;
- to comply with legal obligations or for the performance of a public interest task or exercise of official authority;
- for public health reasons in the public interest;
- for archival, research or statistical purposes; or
- to exercise or defend a legal claim.
- When complying with a valid request for the erasure of data we will take all reasonably practicable steps to Delete the relevant data.

Right to restrict processing: You have the right to request that we restrict our processing of your personal data in certain circumstances. This means that we can only continue to store your data and will not be able to carry out any further processing activities with it until either:

1. one of the circumstances listed below is resolved;
1. you consent; or
1. further processing is necessary for either the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims, the protection of the rights of another individual, or reasons of important EU or Member State public interest.

The circumstances in which you are entitled to request that we restrict the processing of your personal data are:

- where you dispute the accuracy of the personal data that we are processing about you. In this case, our processing of your personal data will be restricted for the period during which the accuracy of the data is verified;
- where you object to our processing of your personal data for our legitimate interests. Here, you can request that the data be restricted while we verify our grounds for processing your personal data;
- where our processing of your data is unlawful, but you would prefer us to restrict our processing of it rather than erasing it; and
- where we have no further need to process your personal data but you require the data to establish, exercise, or defend legal claims.

If we have shared your personal data with third parties, we will notify them about the restricted processing unless this is impossible or involves disproportionate effort. We will, of course, notify you before lifting any restriction on processing your personal data.

Right to rectification: You also have the right to request that we rectify any inaccurate or incomplete personal data that we hold about you. If we have shared this personal data with third parties, we will notify them about the rectification unless this is impossible or involves disproportionate effort. Where appropriate, we will also tell you which third parties we have disclosed the inaccurate or incomplete personal data to. Where we think that it is reasonable for us not to comply with your request, we will explain our reasons for this decision.

Right of data portability: If you wish, you have the right to transfer your personal data between data controllers. In effect, this means that you are able to transfer your Eau de Web account details to another online platform. To allow you to do so, we will provide you with your data in a commonly used machine-readable format that is password-protected so that you can transfer the data to another online platform. Alternatively, we may directly transfer the data for you. This right of data portability applies to:

1. personal data that we process automatically (i.e. without any human intervention);
1. personal data provided by you; and
1. personal data that we process based on your consent or in order to fulfill a contract.

Right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority: You also have the right to lodge a complaint with your local supervisory authority. In Romania this authority is here <http://www.dataprotection.ro/>.

If you would like to exercise any of these rights, or withdraw your consent to the processing of your personal data (where consent is our legal basis for processing your personal data), please send an email to <dpo@eaudeweb.ro>. Please note that we may keep a record of your communications to help us resolve any issues which you raise.

You may ask to unsubscribe from job alerts/or any ways of email communications at any time. Just please send an email to <dpo@eaudeweb.ro>.

It is important that the personal information we hold about you is accurate and current. Please keep us informed if your personal information changes during the period for which we hold your data.
