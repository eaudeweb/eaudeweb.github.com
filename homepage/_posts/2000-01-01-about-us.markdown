Eau de Web is a Romanian software company specialised in Web
development. We're in business in this formula since 2006, but most of
us have worked together as a team since 1999.

We attend trainings and conferences all the time and we keep ourselves
informed about new technologies, solutions and standards. This allows us
use emerging technology when developing applications and also suggest
the suitable solutions to our clients when we start new ones.

Our products and services respect modern standards for accessibility,
syndication and Web services. Most of our work is open source and that's
the way we like it.

Over the years we worked a lot with content management systems and
portal toolkits so we eventually built our own. It's called Naaya, it's
made in Zope and it's fully open source. It's our pride and joy because
it's simple to use, simple to extend and elegant to program. We'll have
a website for it soon.


### The name ###

Eau de Web is a paraphrase of eau de parfum, meaning a fragrance of Web,
close to its essence.


### Eau de Web's Manifesto ###

The drives of our activities are the open source culture and the use of
open standards due to the benefits of code reuse, openness in
participating in projects worldwide, peer review and contributions from
a wide community of developers.
