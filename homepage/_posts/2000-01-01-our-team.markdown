  It's pretty neat to work with us because we are a friendly team â˜º.
  There are twenty of us now, but we're looking for new colleagues:

### Culture & Workplace ###

Do you see any Teletubbies in here? Do you see a slender plastic tag clipped to 
my shirt with my name printed on it? Do you see a little Asian child with a blank 
expression on his face sitting outside on a mechanical helicopter that shakes 
when you put quarters in it? No? Well, that's what you see at a toy store. 
And you must think you're in a toy store, because you're here shopping for an 
infant named Jeb.

### Why work at Eau de Web? ###

<!-- start slipsum code -->

Normally, both your asses would be dead as fucking fried chicken, but you happen 
to pull this shit while I'm in a transitional period so I don't wanna kill you, 
I wanna help you. But I can't give you this case, it don't belong to me. 
Besides, I've already been through too much shit this morning over this case to 
hand it over to your dumb ass.
