### Our office ###

The office is located near Arcul de Triumf, in a quiet neighborhood,
some of us even bike to work. There's a fully equipped kitchen, also an
espresso machine with the best italian coffee, and an exquisite
selection of teas.

We don't cut corners on office furniture and IT -
dual monitors and your choice of Linux, Windows or Mac.

### Employee development ###

Our company helps employees to constantly improve their skills and remain up to date with modern tools and technologies, by means of:

* Encouraging individual contributions to open-source projects and civic initiatives;
* Sponsoring active participation in relevant conferences, events, workshops and training courses;

* Python-based web frameworks (Django, Plone)
* PHP / Drupal
* Modern JavaScript frameworks (Node, Vue, React)
* Automation and infrastructure-as-code tools (Terraform, Ansible)
* Cloud computing platforms (Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, Kubernetes)
