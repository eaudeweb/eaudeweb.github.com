The office is located near Arcul de Triumf, in a quiet neighborhood,
some of us even bike to work. There's a fully equipped kitchen, also an
espresso machine with the best italian coffee, and an exquisite
selection of teas. We don't cut corners on office furniture and IT -
dual monitors and your choice of linux, windows or mac.

We use any excuse to organize a social evening with poker and board
games. The company pays for gym membership and the odd wine party. We go
to conferences and regularly order technical books.

<!-- JOB LISTING -->

Over time we learned to work profesionally. All code is under version
control ([EEA's GitHub repository][eea_github], [our github
account][edw_github]), we write unit tests, any important change goes
through peer code review, and we pair program when it makes sense.
Deployment to staging and production is automated, and we have
specialized people for testing and system administration. We also have
close, long-term relationships with our [clients][] , and we work in
small iterations with quick feedback.
