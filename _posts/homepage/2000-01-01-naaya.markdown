Naaya is an open source portal toolkit with support for content
management, multilinguality, syndication and friendly through-the-web
site administration for webmasters with all kinds of technical
backgrounds.

Naaya target users are people that want to quickly start a website and
reduce to a minimum the need to refer to technical system administrators
for its update and maintenance. They can delegate authority for content
management and local administration to a team of non-technical
contributors. Naaya is also suitable for networks of portals, because of
the integrated search across multiple sites, skinable layout and support
for creating self-installable toolkits.
