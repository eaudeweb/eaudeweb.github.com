  We went to the PyCon US 2011!

There where three of us: Alexandru Plugaru, Alex Morega and Andrei Laza.

It was by far the largest PyCon and we've never seen so many python
programmers in one place (around 1200 attendees). It was comforting to
know that there are so many people that can share their knowledge and
experiences as python developers and as programmers in general so close
to each other.

The conference wasn't just about Python as a programming language. It
was much more. It was about coders, hackers, scientists, companies and
others who use Python every day to solve their problems and are glad to
share their knowledge with you.

There was so much stuff to learn that at some point it got really
irritating that we couldn't attend a lot of important speeches and
discussions. Fortunately there are recordings of every speech (or
almost) here on pycon's blip.tv [channel][].

There where many great talks and lightning talks at PyCon, but there
where a few that were more than great. To name a few:

* [Reverse-engineering Ian Bicking's brain: inside pip and
  virtualenv][pip-talk] by Carl Meyer
* [API Design anti-patterns][antipatterns-talk] by Alex Martelli
* [API Design: Lessons Learned][apilessons-talk] by Raymond Hettinger

We also had the pleasure of participating in sprints. Alexandru Plugaru
and Andrei Laza worked on zc.buildout with guidance from Jim Fulton and
managed to solve a few bugs in the package. Alex Morega worked with the
pip guys.
