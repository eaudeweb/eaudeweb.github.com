We are looking for a senior PHP web developer experienced in Drupal 7 for 
at least one year or two completed projects. A broad experience, from
databases to in-browser apps is a plus.

We build products with open-source technologies. Our toolbox is made up
of Linux, Drupal, PHP, Git, Jenkins, OpenLDAP, jQuery, CSS, and we don't 
hesitate to use other packages where needed.

Checkout [who we are][] and [what we do][] and, if you want to work with
us, send an email to jobs@eaudeweb.ro and tell us about the most
interesting thing you built lately.
