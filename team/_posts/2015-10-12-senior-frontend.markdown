We are looking for a Frontend Senior Developer, with solid experience in JavaScript, able to work with, and/or learn, React, Angular, Meteor or any other library, according to our projectâ€™s requirements.

Using open-source technologies we build web applications for international clients. We use Linux, Git, Python, PHP, Drupal, Django, Django REST Framework, Flask, Zope, MongoDB, PostgreSQL.

Knowledge about frameworks and plugins will be considered a plus, but we are mostly interested in the ability to develop from scratch. The frontend solution is managed through Grunt, and CSS is put together using LESS or SASS.

We make code review and use continuous integration in our projects. We work Agile. This means no overtime.

See [who we are][] and [what we do][] and, if you want to work with
us, please send us a cover letter along with your CV, describing the coolest application you had developed lately.
