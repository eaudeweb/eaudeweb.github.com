We are looking for a junior programmer, eager to expand their web
development knowledge. You need to know Linux and a programming
language.

We build products with open-source technologies. Our toolbox is made up
of Linux, Git, Python, Django, Zope, jQuery, CSS, and we don't hesitate
to use other packages where needed. With us, you will learn to work as
part of a team, ship a product, write tests and documentation.

Checkout [who we are][] and [what we do][] and, if you want to work with
us, send a letter in which you talk about the most interesting thing you
learned lately.
