During 2018-2024 we had a long-term agreement for UX/UI design and software development services with the World Food Programme, world's largest humanitarian organization and provider of food assistance.

Our colleagues took part in the development of [School Connect][school-connect], a smart decision-support tool for managing and monitoring school feeding programs in more than 20 countries.
