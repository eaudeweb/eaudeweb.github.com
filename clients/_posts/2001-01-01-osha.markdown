Together with [Bilbomatica][bbm], the main contractor, we have revamped several websites for EU-OSHA,
including their [main website][osha], [Napo's films][napo] and the [Healthy Workplaces Campaign 2015-2016][hwc].
The websites are build on Drupal 7, responsive and fully translated in all European languages.
