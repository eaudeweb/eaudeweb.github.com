  Web hosting, Python web development and AI-powered cybersecurity tools
---

During 2010-2023 we have been designing, developing and hosting 15+ information systems for ENISA, including their corporate website and several [cybersecurity tools][tools].

Some of these tools use AI technologies (NLP, ML, KR, GenAI) to harvests data from online sources, classify information using knowledge graphs, and  perform machine translation and summarization.
