We built the [Water Sanitation Platform][watsan], which enables African countries
to set up a database and website for monitoring water and sanitation services.
Country portals created on the WatSan Platform are participatory tools for information
dissemination in the water and sanitation sector at national and regional level.
They can be used to generate maps which highlight the distribution of water and sanitation services.
