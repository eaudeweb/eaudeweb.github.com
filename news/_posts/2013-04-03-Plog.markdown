  PLOG is the Plone meeting that, like a good espresso, best matches the definition of "italian style".

We've got a great deal of fun at this Plone event, attending presentations, on sprints and enjoing the beautiful suroundings there in Sorrento. Eau de Web was present at PLOG 2013 with a team of four: Alec Ghica, Alin Voinea, David Batrânu and David Ichim.

Alec Ghica presented ["EEA add-ons overview"][EEAaddons],
an overview of some EEA add-ons developed by Eau de Web, including old and new features, new packages and ideas for the future.

We did a couple of sprints on making some add-ons Dexterity aware, updating http://plone.ro and on releasing and uploading some new add-ong on http://plone.org/products.
