  This year's Plone Conference in San Francisco included two days of training, four
  days of main conference and then two days of sprints. It is always awesome, and
  highly recommended for all Plone developers and customers alike

This was our (Alec and Alin's) 5th Plone Conference in a row. As always was very nice
to keep in touch with the Plone community, to do our usual lighting talks and attend
the sprint sessions.

The talk were interesting and there was an increased interest in [pylonsproject.org][prj]

During sprint sessions we focused on releasing a set of new packages on [plone.org][plone] and
[pypi.python.org][pypi], including updated documentation and final testing on the last Plone
release. By now eea.tags, eea.geotags, eea.relations, eea.daviz, eea.facetednavigation
are into the wild :)
