  We attended the Plone Conf 2010 in Bristol and delivered a presentation on
  Faceted Navigation implementation in Plone

Our work in [Plone][] is quite entensive, so we take a keen interest in seeing what
are the trends, how is the community evolving, and what components Plone programmers
are using. We do our part of contribution to the CMS, by making available the 
components we develop and by providing help in using them. 

Here is Alin's presentation:
