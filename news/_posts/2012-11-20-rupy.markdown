  We got to mingle with our Ruby brothers and learn each others' ways.

In a few short years [RuPy][] has turned into a serious conference about
dynamic languages. The Eau de Web sent a decent-sized delegation (Mihai
Dincă, Bogdan Tănase, Alex Morega) and we came back with new knowledge:

* Upcoming languages (Rust, Dart)
* Application architecture (James Coglan described how they split up a
  big monolithic Rails application at Songkick)
* Good and bad use of relational databases (Andrew Godwin)
* Documenting REST APIs (Lukáš Linhart)
* Packaging code, templates and stylesheets for a single-page app (Nick
  Fisher, SoundCloud)

... and much more. Conference organizers had enough foresight to
distribute annotated maps of beer places in central Brno so we got a
good sampling of local beer and quisine.
