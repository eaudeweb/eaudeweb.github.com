Andrei Laza and Alex Morega from Eau de Web attended [EuroPython][] this
year. It was held in Birmingham and drew hundreds of attendees and quite
a few good speakers.

EuroPython 2010 had four parallel tracks of talks so choosing what to
attend was a challenge. We got to watch many of the people behind Python
and related projects - Zope, Twisted, various testing tools, etc. We
also stayed for the sprints and worked a bit on PyPy and Python core.

A few of the talks and sessions were about local programmer user groups
and meet-ups. These come in many shapes and sizes, from a few people
meeting in a bar, to regular events with presentations or hacking. Since
there's no Python user group in Bucharest, we set about organizing our
own: [PyBucure≈üti][pybucuresti].

We managed to sneak out and visit Birmingham itself. Here are [a few
