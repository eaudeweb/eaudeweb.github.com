  Academic conference in Craiova, Romania, where Miruna presented her paper on
  "Visualization of the European environmental data"
---

[WIMS'12][wims] was organised by the University of Craiova, being the second of a series
of conferences concerned with intelligent approaches to transform the World Wide
Web into a global reasoning and semantics-driven computing machine. 

The conference had one industrial track, where Miruna presented Eau de Web's
latest work for the European Environment Agency in the field of visualization of
semantic data. She described the processes of collecting heterogeneous datasets,
their description and categorization according to semantic Web principles, the
aggregation into a semantic database and eventually the ongoing
project for the generation of different presentations layers (graphs,
maps, charts, etc) using SPARQL queries.
