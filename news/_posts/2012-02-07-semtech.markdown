  We went to SemTechBiz for practical advice, hands-on guidance and meaningful
  takeaways that the business luminaries and subject matter veterans in the area
  of semantic technologies usually bring to the table

Organised in Europe for the first time, we expected from the conference in 
[Berlin][smb] something like the San Francisco
version, but it turned out to be a bit less.

The Semantic Tech & Business conferences are designed to educate individuals
whose firms are learning what semantic technologies are, as well as
organizations who wish to enhance ongoing efforts to leverage semantics in their
enterprise and web-based systems.
Through more than 35 panels, roundtables, plenaries, keynotes and lightning
sessions, SemTechBiz provides an interactive experience and delivers business
value by helping to turn your newly acquired knowledge into actionable results.

Here we are during a break :)
