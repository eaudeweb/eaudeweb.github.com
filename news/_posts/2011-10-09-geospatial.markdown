The Geography department of Bucharest University hosted a [geospatial.org
seminar][] in Bucharest, on 7-8 October 2011 which we (Miruna and Alex)
attended. Most of the first day was for presentations, followed by
workshops, that continued on the 2nd day. Some of the presentation
highlights:

* eHarta is a dataset of digitised historical maps of Romania. It won
  the "better data" award at the [Open Data Challenge][]. These maps,
  and many others, are freely available on [their GeoServer website][].
* Highlights from a century-old account of mapping the Romanian
  coastline.
* An application for maritime and river navigation, showing terrain,
  visual features, boat traffic and water depth cues.
* An overview of the OpenStreetMap database, how to contribute, and
  existing applications.
* Reconstructing a 3D space based on a collection of 2D images.

We attended the workshops about the OpenGeo Suite and GDAL/ORG. This
would have been handy knowledge in building the [AoA map search
interface][], where we discovered mapping the hard way, blisfully
ignorant of some useful open-source tools. Also attended a workshop
about statistics on geographic data using the R language. I suspect
similar results can be achieved using SciPy, but it was a refreshing
look at another way of doing things.
