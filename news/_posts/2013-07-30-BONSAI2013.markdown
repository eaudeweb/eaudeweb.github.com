  Eau de Web supported BONSAI, Bridging Organizations and National Societies in Artificial Intelligence. We spent a few days in the mountains surrounded by wonderful people from France, Greece, Italy, Romania and Spain, highly skilled in AI.

["BONSAI"][bonsai] is about young researchers and innovators with a passion for Artificial Intelligence. While we were mostly interested in connecting to people working with Semantic Web,
it was a trully staggering experience to communicate, think and work at various innovating AI projects amongst researchers and teachers from France, Greece, Italy, Spain and from our country.

The event Eau de Web supported took place at ["Pănicel"][panicel]. While there was no time for riding horses, the people enjoyed presentations from researchers, teachers, businesses and organisations
working for EU funded projects, and of course the last day when the nearby sites were visited: Râşnov citadel, Bran castle, Braşov city.
