  UX Lx is a premier User Experience Conference, held every year in Lisbon since 2008.
  Its fifth edition gathered speakers from Europe and USA and about 290 participants, if Sonia counted well.

During 2 days of workshops and one day of presentations, Sonia learned to listen
to people better, to experiment more when she creates wireframes and to use
mental models when she puts herself in a certain web visitorâ€™s shoes.

She came back from this conference with 3 big wishes: to read by the end of the
year all the UX books she bought from the UX Book Fair, to organize gamestorming
sessions with her co-workers from time to time and
to return to the UX Lx next year.
