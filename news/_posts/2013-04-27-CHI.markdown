It addressed research on all aspects of human-computer interaction (HCI), case studies of interactive system designs, proof-of-concept innovative systems, and presentations on the challenges and innovations in the field.  In addition to a long-standing focus on professionals in design, engineering, management, and user experience, the conference has made special efforts to serve communities in: Child-Computer Interaction, Digital Arts, Games & Entertainment, Health, Sustainability, and HCI4D.
