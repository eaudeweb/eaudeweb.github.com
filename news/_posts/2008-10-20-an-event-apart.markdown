  Our web designer attended the Chicago "event apart", which seems to be the highlight 
  of the year in terms of design

After a 13 hours flight and a long day of chaotic walking through the beautiful city
of Chicago, Razvan headed on an early Monday morning with his extra large Mocha coffee
to the Sheraton Tower. [The show][conf] was started by none other than Jeffrey Zledman and
Eric Meyer, who were just the tip of the iceberg of a 2 day marathon about web design,
web apps, usability, CSS and plenty of more awesome stuff.
