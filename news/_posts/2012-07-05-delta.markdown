  We had a kick-off summer teambuilding on boat in the Delta for a couple of
  days, a small preview to vacations time...

Most of us squeezed on a big hotel-boat and travelled the Delta for a couple of
days. Nothing to do but lay on sun-beds, drink, eat fish and take boat rides on
small channels of the Delta. At night you could hear thousands of frogs and
other creatures chirping in the dark - good time to have a boat night ride and
stop off the engine in the middle of nowhere... or to sit down inside, away from
mosquitoes, and play board games ;-)
